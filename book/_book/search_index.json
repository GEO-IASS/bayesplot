["index.html", "Bayesplot Bayesplot Documentation", " Bayesplot Jonah Gabry May 05, 2017 Bayesplot Documentation bayesplot is an R package providing an extensive library of plotting functions for use after fitting Bayesian models (typically with MCMC). Currently bayesplot offers a variety of plots of posterior draws, visual MCMC diagnostics, as well as graphical posterior predictive checking. Additional functionality (e.g. for forecasting/out-of-sample prediction and other inference-related tasks) will be added in future releases. The plots created by bayesplot are ggplot objects, which means that after a plot is created it can be further customized using the various functions for modifying ggplot objects provided by the ggplot2 package. The idea behind bayesplot is not only to provide convenient functionality for users, but also a common set of functions that can be easily used by developers working on a variety of packages for Bayesian modeling, particularly (but not necessarily) those powered by RStan.
