**bayesplot** is an R package providing an extensive library of plotting functions for use
after fitting Bayesian models (typically with MCMC). Currently **bayesplot** offers a variety
of plots of posterior draws, visual MCMC diagnostics, as well as graphical posterior
predictive checking. Additional functionality (e.g. for forecasting/out-of-sample prediction
and other inference-related tasks) will be added in future releases.

The plots created by **bayesplot** are ggplot objects, which means that after
a plot is created it can be further customized using the various functions for
modifying ggplot objects provided by the **ggplot2** package.

The idea behind **bayesplot** is not only to provide convenient functionality for users, but
also a common set of functions that can be easily used by developers working on a variety of
packages for Bayesian modeling, particularly (but not necessarily) those powered by
[**RStan**](https://github.com/stan-dev/rstan).


## Installing and loading the package

### Installation

* To install the latest release from [CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/package=bayesplot):

```{r, eval=FALSE}
install.packages("bayesplot")
```

* To install the development version from [GitHub](https://github.com/stan-dev/bayesplot) using the **devtools** package:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
install.packages("devtools") # if necessary
devtools::install_github("stan-dev/bayesplot")
```

### Loading the package

The examples in the rest of this documentation assume **bayesplot** has already 
been installed using one of the methods above. 

* To load the package after installation:

```{r}
library("bayesplot")
```
